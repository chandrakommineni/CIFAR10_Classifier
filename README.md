In this  assignment, our objective is to build a neural network featuring two fully-connected layers designed for classification purposes. We will evaluate the performance of this neural network by testing it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This assignment adheres to a standard classification setup, which encompasses the use of a dataloader to load labeled image data in a natural form and training the model in a minibatch-based fashion.
